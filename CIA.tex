Defect prediction is currently the area of an undergoing research.  But instead of predicting defects focus of researchers has now been changed to predicting risky software changes(patches) which would create or open more defects in other files.
\end{justify}\par
\begin{justify}
We have used historical project data which will include changes made to any project’s files and the number of issues caused by those changes.   We have prepared our own dataset using this data and have classified the files into risky, non-risky and neutral classes.
\end{justify}\par
\begin{justify}
Source Code Control systems(eg.git,svn) and defect tracking systems(eg.JIRA) will together provide the historical data required for the project.

\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Overview}
\setlength{\parskip}{0.0pt}
	\item A main objective of this project is to provide a system for reviewing files during the development phase. Reviewing includes checking severity of a file and provide few of the other details associated with it which will help developers to know about the past statistics of queried file.\par

\setlength{\parskip}{9.96pt}
	\item This system will predict the severity class for a given file(low, medium, high) and based on that, the developer might know about what could be the cost of dealing with the given file and what are the major problem areas that are occurred to be problematic which might open defects in near future.\par

\section{Motivation}
\setlength{\parskip}{0.0pt}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Open source has brought the concept of distributed development of application.\par

	\item The Version Control Systems(VCS) play crucial role in development of such systems. Also Defect Tracking Tool like JIRA are majorly used.\par

	\item After pushing code for review, the developer might have no idea if he/she is going to see his work reflected in the final product. Also, even code reviewer cannot talk about efficiency of code snippet and how much error it can open in the overall development.
\end{itemize}\par

\setlength{\parskip}{9.96pt}
\pagebreak \par

\section{Problem Definition and Objectives}
\begin{justify}
Given\ a project, its specific package and a file in that project, we will able to predict the impact of software change  made in that file. We will predict the impact of a software change(s) using the file history associated with Git and JIRA.
\end{justify}\par

\section{Project Scope \& Limitations }
\setlength{\parskip}{0.0pt}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Plugin will receive file name as a input from user and it will return severity of the given file as a output to user on a webpage.\par

\setlength{\parskip}{9.96pt}
	\item It is easy to use tool which uses ANN model deployed over server to return severity class to developer. Developer instead of going to Git and checking JIRA, and analyzing file details manually can directly get file details at few clicks.\par
	
	\item Plugin requires a file to be present in the database.\par
\end{itemize}

\section{Methodologies of problem solving and efficiency issues}
\setlength{\parskip}{0.0pt}
\begin{itemize}
    \item
     A research was done over a dataset to determine which of all the features are actually turning out to be significant for determining the severity of given file. Thus only the required features were used for training a model.
    \par
    \item
    As the data gathered from Git and JIRA is not labelled, it has been clustered as labeled data is fed into an ANN model. K-means gave back clusters as 'Low', 'Medium', 'High'.
    \par
    	\item Artificial Neural Network model is used  for multi-class classification of obtained dataset into Low, Medium and High severity.\par
\end{itemize}


\section{Outcome}
\setlength{\parskip}{0.0pt}
\begin{itemize}
    \item An Eclipse plugin is developed, so that developers can use it.\par
\end{itemize}

\textbf{ }Mining\ software repositories, defect prediction, continuous defect prediction,  software repository, open science\\
\setlength{\parskip}{0.0pt}
\textbf{Abstract:}\par

\begin{justify}
\textbf{ }
In this paper[1], authors have shared the dataset which can be used for continuous defect prediction.They have used GitHub as source code control system and they have used LibGit2Sharp library.Their dataset embraces 1265 software projects, 30,022 distinct commit authors and several software process metrics that in earlier research appeared to be useful in software defect prediction.Their process metrics include various factors such as Number Of Revisions,Number Of Distinct Committers,Number Of Modified Lines etc. 
\end{justify}\par



\subsection{Prediction of Defect Susceptibility in Object Oriented Software[2]}

\textbf{Keywords}: \par

Object oriented, software metrics, cohesion, coupling, defect proneness, fault prediction, defect propagation factor\\
\setlength{\parskip}{0.0pt}
\textbf{Abstract:}\par

\begin{justify}
\textbf{ }
In\ this\ project[2],  they have tried to identify the defect prone software portions.They have implemented this system for Object Oriented System and that too for projects developed in java.For each class they calculated the 7 different metrics using which they predict defect prone software portions.Different metrics include  number of methods in a class ,depth of inheritance tree ,numbers of children ,coupling between objects,Afferent coupling,Lack of cohesion in methods and cohesion among methods.Using the calculated defect propagation factor they are predicting defect prone software portions.\par 
\end{justify}\par

\subsection{Defect Association and Complexity Prediction by Mining Association and Clustering Rules[3]}

\setlength{\parskip}{0.0pt}
\textbf{Keywords}: \par

Defect Associations, Clustering, Defect Correction Effort, Defect association\\
\setlength{\parskip}{0.0pt}
\textbf{Abstract:}\par

\begin{justify}
\textbf{ }
Software defect prediction is combined with association rule mining to determine the associations that occur among the detected defects and the effort required for isolating and correcting these defects. They have used clustering techniques to classify the defects into three classes viz. Simple,Moderate and complex. They have also predicted the defect correction efforts using metrics such as defect type,typological error,bad code and omission error.Based on weighted analysis method, it is determined whether the presence of a particular defect might affect the project schedule significantly.\par
\end{justify}\par


\subsection{Connecting Software Metrics across Versions to Predict Defects[4]}

\setlength{\parskip}{0.0pt}
\textbf{Keywords:}\par

Defect Prediction,Recurrent Neural Networks(RNN).\\
\setlength{\parskip}{0.0pt}
\textbf{Abstract:}\par

\begin{justify}
\textbf{ }
They[4]\ have\ \ proposed  the  use of the Historical Version Sequence of Metrics (HVSM) in continuous software versions as defect predictors\textbf{.}They\ have used Recurrent Neural Network to take HVSM as input to build prediction models.They have focused  on improving the performance in Within Project Defect Prediction(WPDP) with their approaches. HVSM can reveal the ﬁles’ comprehensive change history which are not included in most process metrics.\par

\vspace{\baselineskip}



 
\section{Overview of Project Modules}

\subsection{Introduction}


\begin{justify}
\tab For\ developing plugin, we used Eclipse Plugin Development Environment. REST calls are written in python language. REST calls  to the BMC server were given using Java. All the resources are deployed over Flask server. 
\end{justify}\par

\begin{justify}
\tab For gathering dataset, Git repositories were cloned through JGit API and corresponding JIRA entries were fetched using Atlassian JIRA API. Data is stored in PostGRES database. 
\end{justify}\par

\begin{justify}
\tab Webpage opened in browser is designed in HTML, CSS, Bootstrap Framework and Jinja languages.
\end{justify}\par


\section{Tools and Technologies Used}


\begin{enumerate}
	\item HTML: HyperText Markup Language is the standard language used to create web pages and web applications. HTML describes structure of web pages using HTML elements which are building blocks of web pages.\par

	\item REST API: RESTful API (Representational State Transfer Application Program Interface) is an architectural style to communicate in web services development by using HTTP requests to GET, PUT, POST and DELETE data. These APIs are written in Python language.\par

	\item Python: Python is an interpreted high-level programming language used for general-purpose programming. Watson Conversation provides python APIs to integrate with the dialog tools.\par

	\item BMC Server Machines: These are the servers which are internal to BMC, Pune and are used for deploying a flask server.\par

	\item Flask: Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. All the REST resources were deployed over this server. Flask server runs over BMC Server machines. It contains development server and debugger and also used Jinja2 templating.\par

	\item Jinja2:\ Jinja2 is a modern day templating language for Python development.  It is used to create HTML, XML or other markup formats that are returned to user via an HTTP request. \par

	\item PostGRES: We have used PostGRES database for storing all the records about the file. PostGRES is a ‘open source object relational database management system’. It can handle range of load from small single-user applications to multi-user Internet applications wherein concurrent requests are made to database. \par

	\item Eclipse Plugin Development Environment: Eclipse Plugin Development Environment (PDE) provides a efficient tools for creating, developing, deploying, testing and maintaining Eclipse plug-ins. It also provides comprehensive OSGi tooling, which makes it an ideal environment for component programming.
\end{enumerate}\par


\section{Algorithm Details}

The different modules in the project are as follows:\par

\setlength{\parskip}{0.0pt}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Data\ Collection module:This module deals with cloning of data from BMC GitHub repository and JIRA. This module also deals with mapping the issue in Git with the issue entries in JIRA.  It also establishes connection with the Git repository and JIRA. Data gathered is in the form of .csv file.\par

	\item Database\ module: In this module, data gathered from different branches of  same project is inserted into a PostGRES database. Also a file containing entries for all branches of a project is generated. Attributes of table are number of authors, number of committers, number of revisions, number of lines changed, number of issue, severity of issue raised, kickback count, regression count, problem area etc.\par

	\item Upload data and train module: This module uploads csv file generated over a local file systems to server through a java code. After uploading this module classifies the data in this file into three severity classes namely low, medium and high using K-means algorithm and generates a csv with labelled classes. The labelled file is then used for training ANN model and trained model is then stored over a server.\par

	\item Analyze file module: This module includes a REST call to a service which fetches required details from database against a name of file and passes them to a trained model which is specific to that branch. It gives back result in the form of severity class to end user which opens up a browser on end user’s machine.\par

	\item Delta module: When user tries to clone a repository again, this module helps in bringing only those records which were added after last clone of repository instead of brining entire repository. Code is written in Java. Thus is also updates the necessary entries in database.
\end{enumerate}\par

\subsection{Algorithm 1/ Pseudocode}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item User gives/provides project name, branch name, URL of Git repository as input to fetch module.\par

	\item Based on this input, the git repositories and JIRA details are fetched from github.bmc.com and jira.bmc.com.\par

	\item All the details fetched in the previous step are written to a csv file.\par

	\item Data in csv file is inserted into a database and a merged csv is created which includes data from all the branches of given project.\par

	\item Merged csv is uploaded to a server and is given to ANN algorithm for training.\par

	\item Model is saved with $<$project\_name$>$.h5.\par

	\item When user enters a file name



\begin{justify}
7.1 Details associated with file name are fetched from database.
\end{justify}\par




\begin{justify}
7.2 Number of issues, number of revisions and number of lines changed \tab are given to built model and class is predicted against of it.
\end{justify}\par



\begin{justify}
\item   Severity class is returned to user through REST communication. 
\end{justify}\par

\end{enumerate}\par

\chapter{Software Testing}

\section{Goals of Testing}
\begin{itemize}
    \item To determine the usablity of application\par
    \item As the plug-in is going to be used in the organization, we have to make sure that no test case remains unhandled.\par
    
    \item As there is involvement of BMC Server, we have to insure that how multiple clients work concurrently.\par
\end{itemize}

\section{Test Objective}
\begin{itemize}
    \item To ensure robustness of application.
    \item To make sure about applicability of software built.
    \item To ensure architectural stability of application.
\end{itemize}

\section{Testing Strategy}

\begin{itemize}
\item Unit Testing: There are multiple units/ components in our software. Unit testing is a type of testing used in which individual unit or group of related units are tested. It is a type of white box testing as internal mechanism of system is taken into consideration while testing. It is done to test if each unit is giving expected output for input. \par

\setlength{\parskip}{9.96pt}
	\item Integration testing: It is a phase in software testing in which the units or modules are combined and tested as a group. It is done after unit testing. Unit tested modules are aggregated and tests deﬁned in integration test plan are applied on the aggregates.\par
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Conclusion}

\section{Conclusion}


\begin{justify}
\tab We have developed a Code Impact Analyzer which aims at improving development phase of software system and simplify things for BMC employee upto many extent. This system is deployed in the form of Eclipse plug-in. This system takes name of file from user and gives him/her back a severity class of it. This system attempts to analyze past history of files across all branches of a project. Responses sent by and sent back to end user(developer) is communicated through a REST call. A flask server, which is a micro web server framework, is constantly running over server. All the REST calls are responded back from this server. 
\end{justify}\par

\begin{justify}
\tab The severity class of given file is shown to user on a webpage. The ANN model is written in python language which runs over server itself. Training is module is part of REST services. The dataset used initially for training the ANN model gave us the accuracy of 84.85$\%$  which included all the branches of one project. It had around 3,73,880 records in it. We have also done Chi-square analysis over dataset which helped us to determine the feature importance of fields of data.
\end{justify}\par

\begin{justify}
\tab An Eclipse plug-in is ‘tool-at-hand’ for developer who is handling a new file which might or might not be known to him/her. In this scenario, the developed system can make the things look easier by looking at past history of project and determining severity of file at hand. Not only severity but details like Kickback count, regression count and problem area are also returned back to end user which make him/her understand complete history of file. 
\end{justify}\par

\begin{justify}
\tab We expect that this system will help employees in BMC for developing softwares. This system will surely help company to reduce the time required for Coding Phase of SDLC.
\end{justify}\par

\newpage
\section{Future Scope}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Constructs like Functions, Interfaces of standard programming languages could be taken into consideration while doing analysis of severity class of file.\par

	\item CNN algorithm can be implemented for bringing about rise in the accuracy.\par
	\item Chatbot can be developed for functionality provided by Eclipse plugin.
	
\end{itemize}\par
